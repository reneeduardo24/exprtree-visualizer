aplicación web desarrollada con Angular Standalone + D3.js cuyo objetivo es:\n\nRecibir y validar una expresión matemática ingresada por el usuario.  \nNormalizar la expresión y convertirla a notación postfix.  \nSimular paso por paso la construcción de un árbol de expresión usando un parser basado en pila.  \nMostrar la evolución del árbol en tiempo real mediante D3.js, desde los primeros nodos sueltos hasta el árbol final completamente construido.  \nExplicar en cada paso cuál token se procesa, qué acción se toma y cómo cambia la pila.\n\n\n🚀 Características Principales\n✔ Paso 1 — Entrada y conversión a postfix\nEl usuario ingresa una expresión como:\n(a+b)*c\nEl sistema:\n\nValida sintaxis, caracteres y paréntesis.  \nNormaliza la expresión.  \nConvierte la expresión a notación postfix utilizando un algoritmo de precedencia.\n\nEjemplo:\n(a+b)*c → a b + c *\n\n✔ Paso 2 — Parser paso a paso y visualización dinámica con D3.js\nEl parser procesa postfix token por token:\n\nSi encuentra operando, se apila.  \nSi encuentra operador, desapila dos nodos, crea un nuevo nodo operador y lo apila nuevamente.\n\nEn cada paso:\n\nSe genera un BuildStep con:\ntoken leído  \nacción realizada  \nsnapshot de la pila  \nraíz actual del árbol parcial\n\n\n\nLa visualización:\n\nCuando hay múltiples elementos en la pila, se muestra una raíz virtual temporal para agruparlos.  \nD3.js actualiza el árbol en cada cambio, mostrando cómo evoluciona desde nodos sueltos hasta el árbol final.\n\n\n🧩 Arquitectura del Proyecto\nComponentes
